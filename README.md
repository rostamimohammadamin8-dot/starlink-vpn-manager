## Portable extension modules

The Windows client includes a separate `v2rayN/CustomExtensions` project. It targets `net8.0-windows` and the upstream client's `net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0` framework; the official upstream source, protocol models, parsers, and UI XAML remain intact. The application startup has a small additive bootstrap that stores the Free Config Pack subscription through v2rayN's existing SQLite table and schedules its initial update in the background. Existing tray/close-to-tray behavior is retained.

The storage abstraction provides a relative-path JSON provider for legacy `guiNConfig.json` layouts and a callback-backed SQLite provider. The current .NET 10 client maps SQLite operations to its existing `SubItem` and `SQLiteHelper` APIs; no second database or parallel subscription schema is introduced. `GeoIpService` reads a compatible country MMDB from `dat/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`, caches IP/domain lookups, and returns ISO country names and flag emoji. The supplied portable build uses DB-IP IP to Country Lite (November 2026), not MaxMind GeoLite2; it is included under that runtime-compatible filename and attributed in `PORTABLE-README.txt` under CC BY 4.0. IP lookup itself is offline; resolving a hostname to an IP uses DNS. The RTT helper limits HTTP probes to 100 concurrent requests and marks failures or delays above 5 seconds offline. Its default probe measures direct reachability to Google’s HTTP 204 endpoint; callers must supply a per-profile probe URI to measure through a particular node. On the .NET 10 client, `ConnectToLowestLatencyProfileAsync` uses the native `ProfilesViewModel.SetDefaultServer` path to select and reload the winning profile.

### Build and portable Windows package

Build the official solution with the .NET 10 SDK. The isolated extension project can also be built for .NET 8 Windows:

```powershell
dotnet build .\v2rayN\v2rayN.sln -c Release
dotnet build .\v2rayN\CustomExtensions\CustomExtensions.csproj -f net8.0-windows -c Release
dotnet run --project .\v2rayN\CustomExtensions.Tests\CustomExtensions.Tests.csproj -c Release
```

For a verified archive, place the Windows Xray files in `bin/Xray/`, sing-box files in `bin/sing_box/`, and a licensed, MaxMind-DB-compatible country MMDB at `dat/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`, then run:

```powershell
.\Build-Portable.ps1
tar -tf .\Output\v2rayN-Pro-Portable.zip
```

The script runs the complete sidecar TUnit suite first, rejects tracked or untracked changes under the core `v2rayN/` projects, publishes a self-contained win-x64 WPF app, stages `v2rayN.exe`, `CustomExtensions.dll`, `sidecar-manifest.json`, both core runtimes and the country MMDB, then creates and validates `Output/v2rayN-Pro-Portable.zip`. It cleans only the repository-local `Output/` directory. These runtime binaries and the licensed database are not committed. The current local package uses DB-IP IP to Country Lite under CC BY 4.0 and adds its attribution in the archive; other data sources require their own licensing and attribution checks. The existing `Publish-Portable.bat` remains available for preparing a publish directory; it does not create the named ZIP archive. For tag builds, configure repository variables `XRAY_WINDOWS_ARCHIVE_URL`, `XRAY_WINDOWS_ARCHIVE_SHA256`, `SING_BOX_WINDOWS_ARCHIVE_URL`, and `SING_BOX_WINDOWS_ARCHIVE_SHA256` with GitHub HTTPS ZIP locations and their 64-digit SHA-256 digests; the separate release workflow's `MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY` is for its licensed GeoLite2 download. The release workflow verifies archive hashes and fails with an explicit error when an asset is missing or invalid.

The runtime uses upstream's existing portable data-directory selection and does not force elevation in the manifest. It may fall back to LocalAppData when the application directory is not writable; this extension does not override that upstream behavior. TUN setup may request administrator approval through the existing v2rayN mechanism; an unconditional `requireAdministrator` manifest would unnecessarily elevate every launch.

### Subscription-feed aggregation workflow

`.github/workflows/update-sub.yml` contains the six-hour aggregator intended for `rostamimohammadamin8-dot/Free-VPN-Config-Pack-2026`; it is guarded to run only in that repository. Copy the workflow into that repository's `.github/workflows/` directory and set its `VPN_SOURCE_URLS` Actions variable to newline-separated HTTPS feed URLs. It validates proxy URI schemes, deduplicates and Base64-encodes the nodes, and commits `sub.txt` only when the result changes.
